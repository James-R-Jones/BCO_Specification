### 2.3.1 Extension to External References: SMART on FHIR Genomics

The external references **example** extension to FHIR resource demonstrates how specific data elements can be extracted from EHR systems or other secure FHIR endpoints via technologies such as SMART on FHIR Genomics (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26198304) without compromising patient and providersâ€™ information. This is because the portions being transferred contain no identifiable information about the patient. Instead there is a reference to the actual resource instance (via FHIR URL) through which all data is accessed.

`fhir_endpoint_resource` is a string containing the type of resource used. A full list of permitted FHIR resources is available at http://hl7.org/fhir/resourcelist.html. `fhir_endpoint` is an array of strings containing the URL of the endpoint of the FHIR server containing the resource. `fhir_endpoint_ids` is a string containing the server-specific identifier for the resource instance. The link to FHIR can also be added to the usability domain.  More on FHIR Genomics in release 3 of FHIR can be found here: https://www.hl7.org/fhir/genomics.html

SMART on FHIR Genomics provides a framework for EHR-based apps built on FHIR that integrate clinical and genomic information. For more information on how to use the SMART on FHIR Genomics apps, please visit http://projects.iq.harvard.edu/smartgenomics/.
